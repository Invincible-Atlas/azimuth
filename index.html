      Civil war rages across the galaxy: a war that began four years ago,
      sparked by a simple rescue mission that <em>you</em> carried out.  Each
      of the five member species of the Joint Federation, and even the three
      known SapiAIs, have since been pulled into the conflict, with no end in
      sight.

      As Maj. Shawna &ldquo;Hopper&rdquo; Jemison, a pilot for the UHP
      Interstellar Patrol Force, you must return to the days of that fateful
      mission four years ago.  Your mission: to rescue the trapped colonists
      from a planet-wide disaster, to uncover the secret of Zenith Colony that
      would turn out to begin a war, and to defeat a mysterious enemy that
      threatens all of galactic civilization.

      <i>Azimuth</i> is a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania">metroidvania</a>
      game, and something of an homage to the previous greats of the genre
      (<i>Super Metroid</i> in particular).  You will need to pilot your ship,
      explore the inside of the planet, fight enemies, overcome obstacles, and
      uncover the storyline piece by piece.  <i>Azimuth</i> features a huge
      game world to explore, lots of little puzzles to solve, dozens of weapons
      and upgrades to find and use, and a wide variety of enemies and bosses to
      tangle with.
