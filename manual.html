    <h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
    <img class="floatright" src="images/screenshot1.png">
    <p>
      You are Major Shawna &ldquo;Hopper&rdquo; Jemison, a pilot in the
      Interstellar Patrol Force for the United Human Planets.  For the past
      four years, the once-peaceful Joint Federation of Sentient Races (of
      which the Humans were one of five member species, in addition to the
      three SapiAIs) has been embroiled in civil war, with no end in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four years ago, just before the dawn of the war, you were on patrol near
      the border separating Human space from that of the Trichords (a fellow
      member species of the JFSR), when you received an automated distress call
      from a remote research colony on the planetoid Zenith, home to hundreds
      of Human and Trichord scientists.  As you set course for Zenith to assist
      them, the signal suddenly went dead.  Whatever was happening down there,
      something had just destroyed their transmitter array--a bad sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game begins as you arrive at the colony to find it badly damaged and
      apparently abandoned.  You must explore Zenith to find and rescue the
      colonists, to determine what disaster took place here, and to discover
      the secret that would soon start a galactic civil war...

    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <img class="floatright" src="images/screenshot2.png">
    <p>
      <i>Azimuth</i> is primarily played with the keyboard; you will use the
      mouse on the title screen and pause screen, but not during gameplay.
      There is no special support for gamepads, but any input device that
      emulates a keyboard should work fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default controls are listed below; you can customize these controls
      from the title screen or pause screen by clicking on the
      &ldquo;Options&rdquo; button on either screen.  From there, click the key
      name you want to change, then press the new key you'd like to use.

  <section id="doors">
    <h2>Doors</h2>
    <p>
      Different rooms in the colony are typically separated by doors, which can
      be opened by shooting them.  Some heavier blast doors will require more
      powerful weaponry to break open.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>White Doors</dt><img class="door" src="images/whitedoor.png">

      <dt>Locked Doors</dt><img class="door" src="images/lockeddoor.png">
      <dd>These doors cannot be opened by any weapon.  However, often they can
        be unlocked by defeating a nearby enemy, finding the right switch, or
        entering from the other side.  Once unlocked, they can be opened by
        your regular guns.</dd>

  </section>
  <section id="switches">
    <h2>Switches</h2>
    <p>
      Switches can be activated by shooting them with the right weapon.
      Similarly to doors, switches come in several colors, which hint at the
      right weapon to use.  Activating switches that you find is almost always
      helpful to your mission, so be sure to shoot any that you come across.

    <h2>Enemies</h2>
    <p>
      Zenith Colony is home to many dangerous creatures and robots: from rogue
      security turrets, to wild animals, to alien monsters.  Most enemies can
      be defeated with any weapon, but some enemies have armor that requires
      you to use a more powerful weapon, or to hit them in a vulnerable spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below are a few of the enemies you will encounter while exploring the
      Zenith planetoid:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Security Turret</dt><img class="baddie" src="images/turret.png">
      <dd>These turrets are supposed to keep the colony safe, but they seem to
        have gone haywire.  Some have been damaged and will be easy to destroy,
        while others are armored and impervious to your starting weapon.</dd>
      <dt>Cave Crawler</dt><img class="baddie" src="images/crawler.png">
      <dd>Crawls along walls and ceilings.  Not too much of a threat, as long
        as you don't get too close.</dd>
      <dt>Supply Box</dt><img class="baddie" src="images/box.png">
      <dd>Leftover supplies the colonists didn't have time to take with them
        when disaster struck.  Blast these open with guns to refill your
        shields or ammo.  Some boxes are armored, and will require explosives
        to break open.</dd>
      <dt>Swooper</dt><img class="baddie" src="images/swooper.png">
      <dd>Native flying creatures of Zenith, often found sleeping hanging from
        the ceilings of caves and tunnels.  If disturbed, they will give chase
        at high speed.</dd>
      <dt>Spiner</dt><img class="baddie" src="images/spiner.png">
      <dd>These slowly-drifting creatures shoot spines in all directions if you
        get too close.</dd>
      <dt>???</dt><img class="baddie" src="images/minicrab.png">
      <dd>Mysterious invaders of unknown origin, unlike anything you've ever
        encountered.  Extremely dangerous; engage with caution.</dd>

  <section id="bosses">
    <h2>Tips for bosses</h2>
    <img class="floatright" src="images/screenshot3.png">
    <p>
      Each colored region on the map has a boss enemy that you must defeat to
      gain access to a major upgrade.  The boss room will usually be marked on
      your map once you download map data for that region.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some tips for defeating bosses:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stay calm, and keep moving.</strong>  Most bosses have a
        harder time hitting you if you don't stand still.
      <li><strong>Look for a weak point.</strong>  Some bosses have armored
        sections that can't be damaged by your weapons.  In those cases, look
        for a more vulnerable spot that you <em>can</em> damage.
      <li><strong>Watch your shields.</strong>  Bosses often summon smaller
        minions to attack you, which you can kill to gain shield and ammo
        pickups.  If your shields get low, you may need to temporarily focus on
        fighting minions to refill your shields rather than on fighting the
        boss itself.
      <li><strong>Don't give up.</strong>  Remember, if you can get to the boss
        room, then you already have everything you need to defeat that boss.
        That said, if you still keep dying, try exploring more before heading
        to the boss--there may be optional upgrades you can find that will make
        the fight a little bit easier.
    </ul>

  <section id="gun_upgrades">
    <h2>Gun Upgrades</h2>
    <p>
      There are eight different gun upgrades you can acquire during the game.
      You can use up to two of them together at once, combining their effects.
      For example, using <span style="color:#999">CHARGE</span>
      and <span style="color:#6ff">FREEZE</span> together allows you to charge
      up a powerful shot that is extra effective at freezing enemies, while
      using <span style="color:#66f">HOMING</span> and
      <span style="color:#ff6">PHASE</span> together allows you to fire shots
      that both seek out enemies and pass through walls.  Using the right
      weapons in the right situations is key to survival!
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Charge Gun</dt>
      <img class="upgrade" src="images/chargegun.png">
      <dd>Allows you to charge up your gun to fire a more powerful shot.  With
        the charge gun selected, hold down the fire key (C by default) for a
        few seconds until the sound changes, then release.  Charged up shots
        can damage some armored enemies that are immune to normal shots.  Some
        breakable walls can be destroyed outright by a charged shot; those that
        can't will flash a color when hit by a charged shot, hinting at what
        weapon is needed.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Freeze Gun</dt>
      <img class="upgrade" src="images/freezegun.png">
      <dd>Allows you to freeze enemies in place in addition to damaging them.
        Frozen enemies can't move or attack, and won't damage you if you run
        into them.  Weaker enemies can be frozen with a single shot; stronger
        enemies won't be frozen until most of their health has been depleted
        first.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Triple Gun</dt>
      <img class="upgrade" src="images/triplegun.png">
      <dd>Fires a spray of three shots at once instead of just one, although
        each shot is slightly weaker than normal.  Great for dealing with
        swarms of weak enemies, or situations where aiming accurately is
        difficult.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt>Homing Gun</dt>
      <img class="upgrade" src="images/hominggun.png">
      <dd>Fires shots that automatically seek out nearby enemies; however, each
        shot is significantly weaker than normal.  Try combining this with
        other guns to help offset this weakness.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt>Phase Gun</dt>
      <img class="upgrade" src="images/phasegun.png">
      <dd>Fires a short-ranged shockwave that passes freely through walls,
        allowing you to hit switches and enemies that would otherwise be
        unreachable.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Burst Gun</dt>
      <img class="upgrade" src="images/burstgun.png">
      <dd>Fires powerful shots that burst into shrapnel on impact, potentially
        doing even more damage to nearby enemies.  This burst effect also gives
        you an indirect way to shoot around corners.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Pierce Gun</dt>
      <img class="upgrade" src="images/piercegun.png">
      <dd>Fires shots that pierce straight through multiple enemies,

        up your C-plus drive, you can use this upgrade.  Select bombs, hold the
        ordnance key (X by default) for a few seconds to charge up, then
        double-tap the reverse key (down arrow by default) to drop an orion
        charge.  Your ship will ride the shockwave from the blast, quickly
        accelerating you to a high speed.  Each use consumes two bombs.</dd>

    <h2>Utility Upgrades</h2>
    <p>
      Exploring Zenith isn't just a matter of weapons and combat--you'll need
      all manner of other tools as well.  Below are a few such upgrades you can
      find that will help you during your mission.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Tractor Beam</dt>
      <img class="upgrade" src="images/tractorbeam.png">
      <dd>Once you have this upgrade, hold down the utility key (Z by default)
        to lock onto nearby flashing tractor nodes, allowing you swing freely
        around them at a fixed distance.  This tool has a variety of uses, for
        example allowing you to maintain your speed while turning corners, or
        letting you hitch a ride from one of the automated transport rigs still
        running throughout Zenith.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Tractor Cloak</dt>
      <img class="upgrade" src="images/tractorcloak.png">
      <dd>This experimental cloaking device allows you to hide from enemies or
        motion sensors.  It must be charged up from a tractor node; lock on to
        any tractor node for several seconds, and the cloak will automatically
        activate.  Once you disconnect from the node, the cloak will last for
        several more seconds, or until you fire your weapons.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Magnet Sweep</dt>
      <img class="upgrade" src="images/magnetsweep.png">
      <dd>Once equipped, this upgrade will automatically pull all nearby shield
        and ammo pickups towards your ship.  Very helpful for restocking your
        supplies quickly in a high-pressure situation, without taking away your
        focus.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Sensor Upgrades</h2>
    <p>
      As you search all over Zenith to find the surviving colonists, you will
      need to upgrade your sensors to help find them.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Infrascanner</dt>
      <img class="upgrade" src="images/infrascanner.png">
      <dd>Some areas on Zenith are extremely dark in the visible light
        spectrum; this infrared sensor array gives you increased visibility in
        those areas.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Milliwave Radar</dt>
      <img class="upgrade" src="images/milliwaveradar.png">
      <dd>Many of the upgrades and passages on Zenith are hidden behind
        obstacles.  With this upgrade, you can hold down the utility key (Z by
        default) for several seconds to start scanning for these hidden
        locations.  If there is something to be found in the room you're in,
        the arrow that appears will slowly move to point towards where you need
        to search.</dd>

    <h2>Hint System</h2>
    <p>
      Part of the fun of <i>Azimuth</i> is exploring and discovering on your
      own.  However, if you become frustrated because you really can't figure
      out where to go next, there is a built-in hint system that can help.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enable the hint system, click on the &ldquo;Options&rdquo; button on
      either the title screen or the pause screen, and check the &ldquo;Enable
      hint system&rdquo; box.  Once the hint system is enabled, a new button
      will appear on the Options pane of the pause screen that says &ldquo;GET
      HINT&rdquo;.  If you click this button, it will reveal the next location
      on the map that you should attempt to reach (usually either the next
      upgrade that you need to acquire, or the next story element that you
      haven't seen yet).
